On each players turn, they will have the choice to spin the wheel, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle.
If the wheel lands on a dollar amount, the player can guess a consonant in the puzzle.
If that consonant is in the word, the dollar amount will be added to their round total and the player gets another turn.
If the wheel lands on Lose a Turn, play continues with the next player.
If the wheel lands on Bankrupt, the player loses all of the money they have earned in the current round.
The game continues with the next player.
Vowels cost $250, so the player must have earned at least that amount during a round before buying one.
The player who solves the puzzle wins the round and will have the money they earned during the round added to their total prize.
The player with the most money at the end of 2 rounds will play in the final round for a chance to win an extra prize.
